                        <p> The clock read morning 5am then as I managed to glance at the clock hanging by the side wall. 
                            It was still dark, with thin veil of incadescent light penetrarting the window blinds.
                            I tried to open my eyes my as little as possible, to avoid disrupting the sleep and with the hope that I could get back to sleep again. 
                            I hate waking up in the wee hours of night, especially early morning in a cold December night when it is much easier to cozy up to the warmth of the blanket. 
                            Of late, I have woke up during odd hours of night, mostly owing to the stress of possibly missing early morning Zoom meetings for the office. But today it was unusual. 
                            I heard a distant music of Piano playing somehwere right near to my apartment complex. I live in a modest 1 bedroom rented apartment complex with close neighbors, where it's not unsual to ocassionally hears sounds from neighbors Television or Audio playing equipment.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            There must be new neighors who might have moved in - I thought to myself. And sure enough, they must have some sense of taste in music. Who else would      otherwise be playing classical Piano music at such odd hour of the day, to the extent of risking waking up their neighbors. I also love listening to music a lot, sometimes I'm afraid of playing music loud enough to bother my neighbors in a similar way. This is how others might feel, in case I played some songs loud enough. I do own a relatively loud set of speaker system capable produce some floor shaking bass to annoy an unsuspecting individual. Thankfully, such a situation hasn't rose yet. 
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            Piano is a very soulful instrument - the melancholy of music automatically pushes the mind to explore the very depths of emotions and feelings. At this very moment, I thought about the meaning and shortness of life. We were all born with unique set of genetic combinations, and various environmental factors drove us towards exploring various facets of life. Fleeting moments of success in achieving an academic or professional goal, joy of being together with the loved ones at important life events, or sharing the moments of failure and grief. And time just so quickly passes by - and this brought me back to the present moment again. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I just realized that it's been about 30 mins since I woke up, and sound of that music still lingers on. Probably I had some implicit expectation that the sound will fade away in a matter of time, but contrary to that I felt the source of the sound even closer to me. What was even more strange is that I listened to some piano musical piece earlier in the same evening ! At this point, I started to think if I'm hallucinating or dreaming. No, that wasn't possible either, I'm even more awake and even more concious of the piece of sound. Human mind has uncanny ability to relate such inexplicable situation to errie events, and I'm no exception to that. For a split second, my mind drifted towards the thinking of certain kind of para-normal activity. What if what I'm experiencing now is an act of Ghost ?
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            It's quite funny that our minds can't simply stop thinking of something simply after deciding to do so. Thus while I tried to divert my mind of possible para-normal activity, the more it got drawn to the situation. With my ears even more sensitive to the direction of the sound, I couldn't help but notice that sound was actually originating from my living room. My living room contains both my TV and computer setup, both of which I use for listening to music. Both of the devices are configured to go to automatic sleep mode after certain idle period of time, there were very little if any such possibility. I grew more anxious and curious by every passing minute now. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But sleeping comfortably in the morning hours is something I prize and I cannot allow this incident to ruin my hard earned sleep after long day of work. Thus I mustered enough courage to confornt this "Ghost" playing music. Either I get to the root of the situation, or I get to become one of those very few with experince of "facing" a ghost. I sprung out of my bed, cautiously start to tread towards the living room. Music was unmistakley playing in my living room. Next few steps, I saw lights on my monitor screen, and audio playing out of the connected speaker set. Is this some invisible force operating the system ? 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I stood close by the computer desk, trying to unravel this moment of mystrey. To my utmost surprise, the monitor screen appeared in locked state - only to add even more element of suspense. Holding my breadth, I grabbed on to the mouse and keyboard, and hastily entered my password to log into the system. Within next few seconds, the locked screen gave away to the Desktop screen and this is when I was able to connect all the dots back. 

                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            What happened in summary a computer reboot, as a part of regular Windows patch update and the machine was scheduled to reboot in non working hours sometime between 4-5am. This is what exactly happened, but what also happened was that it restored all my previous working windows. Since I had left the machine on,media player app, it resumed playing the same track from begging. And given the track was about an hour long, it was enough not only for me wake up, but also to go through the entire episode of experience I had. What a silly moment, I thought, not knowing whether to feel annoyed or amused, while also wearing a sigh of relief.   
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that I found my ghost playing music, I trudged my way back to bed again. It was close to 6am, still an hour away from the sunrise, perhaps enough time to allow me to fall back for a peaceful nap again.
